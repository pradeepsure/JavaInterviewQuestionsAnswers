Web Service
Services that can be accessed over network are called web services.
web services are meant for applications to access data in the format of XML, JSON etc.

There are two types of web services.
SOAP: SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol. SOAP is an XML based industry standard protocol for designing and developing web services.
 Since it’s XML based, it’s platform and language independent.
 So our server can be based on JAVA and client can be on .NET, PHP etc. and vice versa.
 
REST: REST is an architectural style for developing web services. 
It’s getting popularity recently because it has small learning curve when compared to SOAP.
 Resources are core concepts of Restful web services and they are uniquely identified by their URIs.

 Java provides it’s own API to create both SOAP as well as REST web services.
JAX-WS: JAX-WS stands for Java API for XML Web Services. JAX-WS is XML based Java API to build web services server and client application.
JAX-RS: Java API for RESTful Web Services (JAX-RS) is the Java API for creating REST web services. 
JAX-RS uses annotations to simplify the development and deployment of web services.

Java RESTful Web Services API
Java API for RESTful Web Services (JAX-RS) is the Java API for creating REST web services. 
JAX-RS uses annotations to simplify the development and deployment of web services. 
JAX-RS is part of JDK, so you don’t need to include anything to use it’s annotations.

Some of the important JAX-RS annotations are:

@Path: used to specify the relative path of class and methods. We can get the URI of a webservice by scanning the Path annotation value.
@GET, @PUT, @POST, @DELETE and @HEAD: used to specify the HTTP request type for a method.
@Produces, @Consumes: used to specify the request and response types.
@PathParam: used to bind the method parameter to path value by parsing it.

Restful Web Services and SOAP
1)	SOAP is a protocol.	REST is an architectural style.
2)	SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol.	REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer.
3)	SOAP can't use REST because it is a protocol.	REST can use SOAP web services because it is a concept and can use any protocol like HTTP, SOAP.
4)	SOAP uses services interfaces to expose the business logic.	REST uses URI to expose business logic.
5)	JAX-WS is the java API for SOAP web services.	JAX-RS is the java API for RESTful web services.
6)	SOAP defines standards to be strictly followed.	REST does not define too much standards like SOAP.
7)	SOAP requires more bandwidth and resource than REST.	REST requires less bandwidth and resource than SOAP.
8)	SOAP defines its own security.	RESTful web services inherits security measures from the underlying transport.
9)	SOAP permits XML data format only.	REST permits different data format such as Plain text, HTML, XML, JSON etc.
10)	SOAP is less preferred than REST.	REST more preferred than SOAP.
