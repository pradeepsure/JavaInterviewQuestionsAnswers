Comparable vs Comparator

Comparable meant for default nature sorting order
Java.lang package
one method compareTo() available
all wrapper classes and String class implements comparable


Compartor meant for customized nature sorting order
java.util package
compare() and equals() method
Two classes implements Collator and RuleBasedCollater classes


Exception
=========
An unwanted unexpected event that disturbs normal flow of Programme.


If something goes wrong we have to handle that situation

purpose
if something is wrong we should not loose anything -> grasefull termination


defining alternative way to continue rest of the programme normally is nothing but exception handling


Hieraricy
=========

	Throwable(Class)

1)Exception         2)Error -> VM Error,StackOverflowError,

--->Exceptions are recoverable

--->Programmers need to handle

===>Errors are not caused by programes

====>Errors are not recoverable   example: Due to lac of system resourses 







1)RuntimeException  -> ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException,ClassCastException
2)IO Exception -> EOF Exception, FileNOtFoundException
3)Interrupted Exception
4)RemoteExcetpion










CheckedException: Exceptions are checked at compile time

RunTimeExceptions: Exceptions are cursed at runtime


above are wrong statements

all exceptions come at runtime


Exceptions which are checked by compiler for smooth execution of the programme at runtime 


CheckedException: UnreportedException: Must be caught: must use try catch or Throws


Exception which are checked by compiler for smooth execution of the programme at runtime , weather the programme handling or not


UncheckedException:
==================
Arithamatic Exception: Runtime Exception


All errors are UncheckedException


throw an exception to jvm

Throw: To handover our created Exception object to the jvm manually

Throws: responsiblibilty to handle caller


throws only for checked exception















Serialization
=============
The process of Converting objectform to filesupporting form or n/w supported form 

saving state of object to a file 

FOS(Write the binary data to the file)
OOS(Take object and convert into binary data)


Deserilization
==============
the process of converting filesupporting form to object form


FIS(Read the binary data)
OIS().readObject()


NONSeirilizable exception at runtime if you are not implemented seriliazable interface(java.io)


Transient is modifier only applicable for variable

static transiant
final transiant
|
no use



autoclossable resourses not reasigned
