1)in how many ways we can create a object in java?
2)in which ways of object creation the constructor doesn’t get called?
3)how to create an object without using a new keyword?

always puzzles us.so with these series of tutorials we will get to know all these questions answers.
in my coming tutorials I am going to cover all other ways to create objects in java like : 
1)by using newInstanse method of Class class
2)by using newInstanse method of Constructor class
3)by clone() method of object class 
4)by using serialisation


1)to create an object by using newInstance method of Class class. NewInstance method can be used as an alternative to creating an object in java.
As we have discussed creating an object using new keyword in the tutorial before, This will be our second way to create an object in java.

2)To create an object using newInstance() of Constructor class. we will also learn what are the differences between the Class class newInstance() and the Constructor class newInstance() ? 

As we are discussing about different ways to create object in java , and we already covered 
how to create an using new keyword 
creating object using class.forname in java (using newInstance method of Class 

so this is going to be our third way to create an object in java.

The various difference between the Class class newInstance() and the Constructor class newInstance() are 
class.newInstance() always look for the no args constructor but the Constructor.newInstance() can invoke any kind of Constructor regardless the parameter.
class.newInstance() requires the constructor to be visible but the Constructor.newInstance() can also invoke the private constructor in certain circumstances.
class.newInstance() throws all the exception that your constructor throws to you but Constructor.newInstance() always wraps all the exceptions thrown by your constructor to an single exception called InvoationTargetException.

The Constructor class newInstance() used widely across lot of frameworks like Spring,Hibernate,Struts and etc.

When we call Class class newInstance() it internally calls the Constructor class newInstance( ) to create an object.

both the newInstance() called as reflective ways to create an object in java so lets talk more about java reflection in this tutorial.





3)object cloning in java and will guide you to create object by using java clone method.

few things to know about clone() method  in java: -

object cloning  is a way to create an exact copy of an object
You must implement java.lang.Cloneable interface to make your classes eligible for cloning.(implementing java cloneable interface)
java clone method throws clonenotsupportedexception.
the constructor doesn’t get called while we create an object by using java clone().  
java clone method exists in java.lang package (java.lang.Object)

So lets get started with java cloning concept.So as we are discussing about “different ways to create an object in java” , creating an object by using clone method of java is going to be the 4th way to achieve it. clone method in java is one of the 11 methods present inside java.lang.Object class.



4)how to create an object in java by using deserialization in java. We will see a complete example of serialization and deserialization process throughout this tutorial and we are going
to keep our tutorial short as we are only covering  'different ways to create an object in java”.

few things to remember : 

To make your classes eligible for serialization make sure your classes implements serializable interface.
To write serialize object to your file use writeObject and use readObject method during deserialization to get your object back.
no constructor get called while we deserialize an object.
