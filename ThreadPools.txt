each time you create threads 

1 Thread = 1 OS Thread 

1000 tasks asyncronusly if you have 1000 threads

1 java coresponding to 1 os threads

creating a thread is a expencive

a Pool of thread submit 1000 tasks to 10 threads

ThreadPoll is using Blocking queue

ideal poolsize is 


Java Provides 4 types of ThreadPools
====================================
1)Fixed Thread Pool
2)Cashed Thread Pool
3)Scheduled Thread Pool
4)Single Threaded Executor
